 <p>Hello! My name is Ashley and I am a full-time student at Seattle Central College. This is my 4th quarter at the college and I am on the Web Development track. I've always loved to design websites, but I decided on this track to learn more of the programming aspects which are so valuable!</p>

 <p>On a more fun, personal level I am a pretty big nerd who loves her dog and loves Seattle. I'm into gaming (RPGs are where it's at), anime, music (lots of concerts, mostly of the rock variety), writing, and drawing. I love to adventure around Seattle. I moved at the beginning of last year from Idaho and have yet to miss where I'm from. I can take the rain, and the sunny days make it oh so worth it!</p>
